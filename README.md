# Gentle Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks, Tensorflow and Tensorboard



This is a bit silly introduction to Recurrent Neural Network. The main
idea is that in order to understand well how Tensorflow works ones has
to program something easy in python and then rewrite in Tensorflow and
see if she/he gets the same result.

We are also showing how to use TensorBoard.
